**"Tensor PCA for Factor Models"** with Andrii Babii and Eric Ghysels, *R&R*

*Abstract:* Modern empirical analysis often relies on high-dimensional panel datasets with non-negligible cross-sectional and time-series correlations. Factor models are natural for capturing such dependencies. A tensor factor model describes the multidimensional panel as a sum of a low-rank component and idiosyncratic noise, generalizing traditional factor models for two-dimensional panels. We propose an estimation algorithm called tensor principal component analysis (TPCA) to estimate factors and loadings. We provide the asymptotic distribution theory and propose a test for the number of factors in a tensor factor model. The asymptotic results are supported by the Monte Carlo experiments, and the new tools are applied to sorted portfolios.
