I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics specializing in econometrics, financial econometrics, asset pricing, and applied econometrics.

I am working on projects that involve tensors, factor models, portfolio selection, machine learning, etc.

A brief introduction to my job market paper:

A factor model aims to explain the co-movements of large number variables (observable) with only a few factors (latent variables).
